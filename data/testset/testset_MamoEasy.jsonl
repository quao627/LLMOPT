This could reflect strategic priorities or market demand patterns.\\n\\nGiven these conditions along with requirement that all allocations are integers because of practical considerations (such as labor hours or machine usage), what is the minimum total cost when optimal resource allocation within specific bounds on each production line is achieved? Provide your answer rounded off to nearest whole number."}
{"id": 96, "ground_truth": 2050, "question": "A transportation company is planning to allocate its fleet of vehicles across three different routes: X, Y, and Z. The total number of vehicles available for these routes cannot exceed 1000 due to resource limitations. To meet the minimum demand, route X requires at least 300 vehicles, route Y requires at least 200 vehicles, and route Z requires at least 150 vehicles. Each vehicle allocated to routes X, Y, and Z incurs costs of $3, $2, and $5 respectively. The company aims to minimize the total cost while adhering to these constraints and ensuring that all allocations are in whole numbers due to the indivisible nature of the resources being allocated. What is the minimum total cost required for this allocation plan? Please give your answer in dollars rounded to the nearest whole dollar."}
{"id": 97, "ground_truth": 93, "question": "A company manager needs to schedule employees for a particular task in three different shifts: morning (X), afternoon (Y), and night (Z). Due to the nature of the task, the total number of employees scheduled across all three shifts cannot exceed 24. The company policy requires at least 4 employees to be scheduled for the morning shift, at least 6 for the afternoon shift, and at least 5 for the night shift. Each employee's salary varies according to their shift: it costs $8 per hour for an employee on the morning shift, $6 per hour for an employee on the afternoon shift, and $5 per hour for an employee on the night shift. The manager aims to minimize labor cost while adhering to these constraints and ensuring that each shift is staffed with whole numbers of employees due to scheduling practicalities. What is the minimum total labor cost required for this operation? Please provide your answer in dollars rounded off to nearest whole number."}
{"id": 98, "ground_truth": 800, "question": "In a military logistics operation, a commander needs to allocate resources between four types of units: Tanks, Aircrafts, Ships, and Drones. The allocations must be whole numbers due to the nature of the units. The total number of Tank and Aircraft units that can be supported is limited to 1000 due to logistical constraints, while the total number of Ship and Drone units cannot exceed 600. Additionally, there should always be at least 200 more Tanks than Ships and no more than 50 difference in quantity between Aircrafts and Drones.\\n\\nEach unit type requires different support points as follows: each Tank requires 4 support points, each Aircraft requires 3 support points, each Ship requires 5 support points and each Drone requires 2 support points. Also note that the maximum allowable quantity for each unit type are as follows: Tanks - 700 units; Aircrafts - 400 units; Ships -300 units; Drones -250 units.\\n\\nThe commander aims to minimize the total support points allocated while adhering to these constraints. Calculate the minimum total support points required for this operation."}
{"id": 99, "ground_truth": 10000, "question": "A retail store manager needs to decide on the inventory levels for two product categories: X and Y. The objective is to minimize the total cost of carrying these inventories, given that each unit of category X costs \\$20 and each unit of category Y costs \\$30. The combined inventory level for both categories cannot exceed 500 units due to storage limitations.\\n\\nIn order to satisfy customer demand and maintain a diverse product offering, the combined effect calculated as three times the units of category X plus twice the units of category Y must be at least 1000. Additionally, four times the units from category X should not exceed by more than 600 from those of category Y.\\n\\nConsidering that inventory levels need to be whole numbers due to their physical nature, and also there are specific bounds on how many units can be carried for each product (400 for X and 300 for Y), what is the minimum total cost in dollars required? Please round your answer to nearest dollar."}
{"id": 100, "ground_truth": 28, "question": "In a scheduling scenario, a company needs to allocate working hours between three teams: $X1$, $X2$, and $X3$. These could represent different shifts or different types of work. The total working hours for each team are constrained as follows: Team $X1$ can work between 0 to 24 hours, Team $X2$ can work between 0 to 12 hours, and Team $X3$ can work between 0 to 30 hours. Each hour of work for the teams costs the company differently, with costs being 5 units for team $X1$, 6 units for team $X2$, and 3 units for team $X3$. \\n\\nThe allocation must adhere to the following operational constraints:- The combined effort of twice the hours worked by Team X1 plus thrice the hours worked by Team X2 plus the hours worked by Team X3 must be at least equal to ten.- The combined effort of four times the hours worked by Team X1 plus five times the hours worked by Team X2 plus twice the hours worked by Team X3 cannot exceed twenty.- The difference in effort measured as one time of hour worked by Teams X1 and X3 minus two times that of team X2 should be at least eight.\\n\\nGiven these conditions and aiming for whole numbers of working hours due to practicalities (Teams cannot work fractional shifts), what is the minimum total cost for the company given these constraints on scheduling? Provide your answer rounded off to nearest whole number."}
